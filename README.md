# Image-Area-Draw-Calc
This is just a placeholder for a simple web app that I want to make in the future

I want it to do a couple things:

- Upload an image
- Allow the user to select drawing colors including alpha 
- Allow user to change brush size (brush shape?)
- Allow user to draw on the image with multiple overlapping sections
- Track what areas were drawn on and how much area was covered
- Report percentage of areas relative to each other or to the whole image
- Report areas of specficic drawings? Will need a scale bar to get pixels to real measure.

Unsolved problems now:
- How to track area
  - Keep running track of colored sections
  - Use some sort of fancy steganography that tracks everthing then calculates after, but this would be harder and maybe not worth it.
- How many colors should be allowed
- How to describe relationships between areas
- Should I include absolute areas too?
